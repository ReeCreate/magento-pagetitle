## magento-pagetitle ##
### by ReeCreate ###
- A very basic Magento extension in the form of an observer that rewrites Magento page titles.
- Tested in Magento CE 1.9, but there's not much to it so it should probably work with most versions
- Developed for woolwarehouse.co.uk and open sourced because... well, why not?

### Page Title Formatting ###
Currently works as such:
#### Category Pages ####
[Category Name] - [Title Suffix]
#### Product Pages ####
[Product Name] - [Title Suffix]

*(Where Title Suffix is set in Admin -> Configuration -> Design -> HTML Head)*

### Installation ###
Just copy the files into your Magento installation as-is, preserving the folder structure.
