# magento-pagetitle 
## by ReeCreate

A very basic Magento extension in the form of an observer that rewrites Magento page titles.

Tested in Magento CE 1.9.

Developed for woolwarehouse.co.uk and open sourced as an experiment.

## Page Title Formatting

Currently works as such:

### Category Pages
[Category Name] - [Title Suffix]
### Product Pages
[Product Name] - [Title Suffix]

(Where Title Suffix is set in Admin -> Configuration -> Design -> HTML Head)

## Installation

Just copy the files into your Magento installation as-is, preserving the folder structure.
